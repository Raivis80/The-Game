## ***Introduction***

**Single-player reaction time game** 

This is my second of four Milestone Projects that the developer must complete during the Full Stack Web Development Program at The Code Institute. 

The main requirement for this project is to write interactive web applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).

To manipulate the DOM as much as possible, I'm building a simple JavaScript single-player reaction time game.<br> 
The objective of this game is to click or tap the objects that are spawning randomly on the screen as quickly as you can.<br>
The difficulty will increase throughout the game.

### **Features To implement**
After user testing, here are some of the suggested future features to implement for the game:
1. Randomize the target on-screen trimming
1. Add level indicator on when it is changing.
1. And After game stats on the game over screen

# [&#8686;](#Top)
## **Game Design Features**
### **Game Mechanics**
1. Game Play
    - Select a difficulty level to start the game.
    - Click or tap on target objects once they spawn.
    - As you progress in the game, target count will increase along with speed
    - If a player misses the target, the black object will spawn instead, if clicked, ends the game altogether
1. Select Level 
    - Touch-enabled devices start with higher speed.
    - Levels for mobile devices  = "Easy" Start with one target, "Medium" start with two targets "Hard" start with three targets.
    - Levels for PC's devices  = "Easy" Start with two targets, "Medium" start with three targets "Hard" start with four targets.
1. Score Counters
    - Score counter:
        - Will increase by one once the player clicks on the target.
    - Missed score counter:
        - Will increase by one if the target is not clicked on time or target is, missed altogether.
1. Lives Remaining
    - The game starts with three lives.
    - One game life is gained every 50 score points. 
    - Maximum of three lives can be gained at once.
    - If the player fails to click on a target or fails to click target on time, one game life will be deducted and the black object will spawn. 
    - Losing all lives means game over.
### **Game Logic**  
![Here](project_files/wireframe2.jpg)
*** 
- Select Level
    - Added touchscreen detection, for mobile devices starting speed is faster than pointing enabled devices.
    - Levels for mobile devices  = "Easy" Start with one target, "Medium" start with two targets "Hard" start with three targets.
    - Levels for PC's devices  = "Easy" Start with two targets, "Medium" start with three targets "Hard" start with four targets.
        - Level target count and speed could be set in the game.js file 

Following is to detect touch devices & add one extra target for touch-enabled devices & and set speed 
```JavaScript 
if ('ontouchstart' in window) { //<-Detect Touch devices
         speed = 2800; // <-Set game starting speed and everything else will change dynamically
        for (cube of cubes) {//<-IIf Touchscreen device detected, select level buttons show extra cube for consistency  
        cube.style.display = 'block';
        cube++ 
        }
    } else {
    //starting speed pc|
    speed = 3000; //<-Starting speed, with pointing devices
}

Starting Target count 
        if ('ontouchstart' in window) {
            objectCount = 4; //<-If Touchscreen device detected start with four targets  everything else, will change dynamically
        } else {
            objectCount = 3; //Else start with 3
        }
        startTheGame();
```
***
- Lives Remaining
    - Based on capture and click events, all Unsuccessful clicks and missed on-time events will disable one life element.
    - Based on the Score counter, every 50 score points will create one life. Enable one life element (if statement)
```JavaScript
//Set this to adjust How many points will add one life, This number must divide evenly with 100
pointsForLife = 50;
```
***
- Random Number generator
    - Extract Window height and width.
    - Create random number integer of a current window width and height.
```JavaScript
// get random position depending on screen size 
function posotioning() {
    w = gameWindowElement.offsetWidth;
    h = gameWindowElement.offsetHeight;
    x = Math.floor(Math.random() * (w - 50)) + 'px';
    y = Math.floor(Math.random() * (h - 50)) + 'px';
}
```
***
- In game target objects
    - Target HTML div elements in the DOM for game box targets.
    - Two random generated integers used for position x and y coardinates to target css position properties for HTML div elements.
```JavaScript
// append color and position for individual targets 
function objects() {
    for (let i = 0; i < objectCount; i++) {
        randColor = colours[(Math.random() * colours.length) | 0]
        posotioning();
        targets[i].style.display = 'block';
        targets[i].style.left = x;
        targets[i].style.top = y;
        targets[i].style.backgroundColor = randColor;
    }
}
```
***
- Click event listeners and capture events.
    - Create event listeners for game targets that will record successful clicks and disable target once clicked. If not will take away one life
```JavaScript
//target event listeners + styling once clickeed display none is set
function targetSetup() {
    for (let i = 0; i < objectCount; i++) {
        livesDivElement.style.transition = ".6s";
        targets[i].addEventListener('click', clickEvent = () => {
            targets[i].style.display = 'none';
            scoreCount = score.innerText;
            livesLogic();
        })
    }
}

```
***
- The Following is to detect unsuccessful clicks. I have added an event listener for the game window to record missed clicks, and I have added a flash effect for visual warning.
```JavaScript
//miss target Flash efect
function missedEffect() {
    gameWindowElement.style.backgroundColor = 'rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.2)';
    setTimeout(resetEffect, 20);

    function resetEffect() {
        gameWindowElement.style.backgroundColor = 'oldlace';
    }
}

// detect game window clicks
function gameWindow() {
    // Game window mousedown listener
    gameWindowElement.addEventListener('click', detectWindowEvents);

    function detectWindowEvents(event) {
        //Prevent click event trigger on child elements.                                    
        if (this === event.target) {
            missedEffect();
            clicks = 0;
            streak2 = 0;
            streak1 = 0;
            livesCount--;
            badListener()
            scoreMissed.innerText++;
            countDifference();
            deductLife()
            livesDivElement.style.width = '0';
            gameWindowElement.style.backgroundColor = 'rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.2)';
        };
    };

}

```
***
- Capture events on all failed click attempts. I managed to achieve this by counting how many objects at the end of setInterval() cycle has display: none; 
```JavaScript
//Timing for target check if display none count is less than initial target count then it will be, sent to not click() function, for calculation
let notClick = 0;
function timigFunction() {
    
    notClick = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < targets.length; i++)
        if (targets[i].style.display === 'block') {
            notClick++;
        }
    if (notClick >= 3 && objectCount >= 3) {
        stopTheGame();
    } else if (notClick == 2 || notClick == 1) {
        livesCount = livesCount - notClick;
        deductLife()
    }
    console.log(livesCount)
    notClick = 0;
}
```
***
- The following is the logic to Deduct life/lives if missed target/s 
```javascript
// Deduct one life if the target is missed
function deductLife() {
    if (livesCount == 2) {
        missedEffect();
        lives[0].style.backgroundColor = 'oldlace';
        livesDivElement.style.width = '0'
        clicks = 0;
        difference = 0;
        scoreStreak.innerText = 0;
        streak2 = 0;
        streak1 = 0;

    } else if (livesCount == 1) {
        missedEffect();
        lives[0].style.backgroundColor = 'oldlace';
        lives[1].style.backgroundColor = 'oldlace';
        livesDivElement.style.width = '0';
        clicks = 0;
        difference = 0;
        scoreStreak.innerText = 0;
        streak2 = 0;
        streak1 = 0;

    } else if (livesCount <= 0) {
        missedEffect();
        setTimeout(stopTheGame, 30);
    }
}
```
***
- Game setup
    - Based on Level selection. if "EASY", else if "MEDIUM", else if "HARD".
    - Level variable will be passed into the setInterval() function and will launch the game.
```JavaScript
// The game setup adds listeners and so on
function startTheGame() { 
    startGameElement.style.display = 'none';
    livesDivElement.style.width = '100%';
    levelsElement.style.display = 'none';
    gameWindow();
    targetSetup();
    levelH(speed);
}

function levelH(speed) {
    timer1 = setInterval(timingF, speed);//<-This set interval method Timing for game loop is' set dynamically 
    function timingF() { //<-The game set interval loop function.
        objects(); //<-Targets
        setTimeout(timigFunction, timing, ); //<-The timeout method to check the remaining target's timing is just at the end of the set interval time.
    }
}
```
***
- Game Progress levels
    - Speed will increase over, course of the game. 
    - Target count will increase over, course of the game.
    - Create setInterval() function passing, it into game level selection once desired score is, reached.
```JavaScript
//Set this to increase progress speed add targets as you like here
// points needed for progress
let progressPoints = 200;
//Speed progress multiplier
// adds an object on progress
function gameProgress() {
    if (progressPoints == score.innerText && objectCount <= 12) {
        progressPoints = progressPoints + speedScore;
        speed = speed - 200;
        timing = speed - 100;
        objectCount++; //< adds one target once every point is set for progress
        let listen = objectCount - 1;
        setTimeout(() => {
            targets[listen].addEventListener('click', addClickEvent = () => {
                targets[listen].style.display = 'none';
                scoreCount = score.innerText;
                livesLogic();
            });
        }, 20);
    }
}
```
***
- If a player misses the target,  one life will be deducted and a black object will spawn instead, if clicked, ends the game altogether. Black object will resset if 100 point streak reached.
```javascript
//bad targets
function badObjects() {
    for (let i = 0; i < badCount; i++) {
        posotioning();
        bad[i].style.display = 'block';
        bad[i].style.left = x;
        bad[i].style.top = y;
        bad[i].style.backgroundColor = 'black';
    }
}
// bad listeners
function badListener() {
    badCount++;
    console.log(bad.length, badCount)
    bad[badCount - 1].addEventListener('click', clickEvent = () => {
        stopTheGame()
    });
} //remove bad listener
```
